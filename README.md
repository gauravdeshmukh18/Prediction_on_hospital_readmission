# Prediction_on_hospital_readmission
Prediction on hospital patients readmission by using k-means clustering algorithm.

## Overview
In this project, we are going to predict the readmitted number of patients in the hospital, by using unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as k-means clustering.
We will follow the required steps of a Data Science lifecycle for the best prediction.

## Conclusion
We tried to build a model for the number of readmitted patients and we got to know that how many patients are readmitted.
